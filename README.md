# Movie website project

Running `python entertainment_center.py` will open a window that contains
information about the movies designated in the `entertainment_center.py` file.

The `fresh_tomatoes.py` file contains the CSS for styling the page and the HTML
for laying thing.

The `media.py` just contains the blueprint for the movie Python class.
